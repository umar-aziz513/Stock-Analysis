                                               ***All Stocks Analysis***

**Overview**

The primary objective of this project was to discover which Stock from the list of 12 has the highest potential for return on investment, based on the change in value throughout the year, for the previous two years; 2017 and 2018. 
The secondary objective was to figure out a way to improve the vba script so the overall timing to calculate the results could be reduced.

**Results**

From matching the overall performance of the stocks between year 2017 and 2018, we can conclude that stock “ENPH” is the safest and most reliable stock to invest in, due to its consistency in increased return.  As shown above, in the tables, ENPH is the only stock that experienced an 80%+ increase in value for both the years, unlike majority of the stocks that significantly declined in value in the year 2018.  The makes ENPH the most stable stock.

  ***Script Improvement***

Original Script

Refactored Script

As shown above, by making slight changes in the script, the execution time reduced by little more than 4 seconds for both years.

**Summary**
To summarize, one of the main benefits of refactoring a code is it enhances the efficiency since it reduces the overall timing.  The longer it takes the code to execute, the higher the possibility of errors to take place. However, one of the downside of refactoring is that it requires higher skill set and knowledge to be able to refactor a code, which takes time to attain.
